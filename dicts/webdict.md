# Webdict

Webdict is a website which presents Giellatekno dictionaries. It is currently
running on [gtweb.uit.no/webdict/](https://gtweb.uit.no/webdict/).

It is a rewrite of the old Webdict, with the same idea of being a simplistic
and fast web interface for dictionary contents. The new site aims to have a
cleaner design, to look good on mobile, and to be completely usable even without
an internet connection (provided of course that the site has been visited before).

## Source code and repository

The project has an open source license, and the source code is located at
[github.com/giellatekno/new-webdict](https://github.com/giellatekno/new-webdict).
Use the issue tracker for any issues with the site, or contact us by email.
