# Webdict

Webdict is a website which presents Giellatekno dictionaries. It is currently
running on [http://gtweb.uit.no/webdict/][http://gtweb.uit.no/webdict/].

It is a rewrite of the old Webdict, with the same idea of being a simplistic
and fast web interface for dictionary contents. The new site aims to have a
cleaner design, to look good on mobile, and to be completely usable even without
an internet connection (provided of course that the site has been visited before).


## Repository

The source code is located at https://github.com/giellatekno/new-webdict. Use
the issue tracker for any issues with the site.


## Hosted at gtdict

It's currently running on gtdict. It's a docker image, which the globally installed
nginx proxies to the /webdict url.
