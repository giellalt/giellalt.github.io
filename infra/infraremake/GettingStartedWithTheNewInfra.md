# Getting started with the GiellaLT infrastructure

You probably came here from our
[Getting Started guide](../GettingStarted.html). This page explains how to check out the source code you need and how to set it up.

1. **Find the three-letter code** of the language you work on
    - Make sure you know the three-letter **ISO 639-3** code of your language (see e.g. the infobox of the Wikipedia article for your language).
    - In case you don't know whether we have a model for your language, the GiellaLT languages are found on [this list](../../LanguageModels.html).
2. Then **fetch the source files** for the languages you want, using `git`
    - [See this document for how to set up the files](../SetUpTheFiles.html)
2. Now **go back to to [Getting Started page](../GettingStarted.html)** for the last step towards building, using and developing the linguistic analysers.
