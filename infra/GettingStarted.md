# Getting started with the GiellaLT infrastructure

This page enables you to _build, use and develop the GiellaLT grammatical tools_ yourself. Go through each of **the steps 1-2-3** below. After each step return to this page for the next step.

If you do **not** want to compile the tools yourself, but only want to **use ready-made grammatical analysers out of the box**, stop reading now and see the [Linguistic analysis page](../ling/LinguisticAnalysis.html) instead.

## Installing in three steps

Conduct the setup of the GiellaLT infrastructure **in these three steps:**

### _Step 1._ Set up the computer

Set up the computer, using these instructions, for:

- [Macintosh](GettingStartedOnTheMac.md) // [Linux](GettingStartedOnLinux.md) // [Windows](GettingStartedOnWindows.md).

### _Step 2._ Fetch the source code

- [Download the core files and the language(s) you need by following these instructions](infraremake/GettingStartedWithTheNewInfra.md)
- <small>**Skip the point following here unless you know you need it:** (People working with dictionaries and icall (mainly Troms√∏ folks) wil also need [these _svn_ files](https://gtsvn.uit.no/langtech/trunk/). Follow [these instructions for download](../tools/docu-svn-user.md))</small>

### _Step 3._ Compile the analysers

The page [Compiling And Using The Analysers](CompilingAndUsingTheAnalysers.md)
tells you how to do just that.

---

Then you are done, and can start using the analysers and/or participate in the development work.
