# Registering languages in LibreOffice

**NOTE!** This info may be outdated.

The process of adding languages in LibreOffice is documented here:

-\* [LibreOffice Localization_Guide: How To Submit New Locale Data](https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/LibreOffice_Localization_Guide/How_To_Submit_New_Locale_Data)

- [The Locale Generator](http://www.it46.se/localegen/select_lang.php) (for generating new locale data)
- [How to add the new language](https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/LibreOffice_Localization_Guide)

Save the resulting xml file in the `proof/spelling/hfst/locale/` folder (perhaps).

Thereafter, the new language must be added to LO. Register at
[bugs.freedesktop.org/](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/), and file a bug saying the language is missing,
with the xml file as an attachment.
