Installing spellers on machines with a separate admin account
====================


Institutions often distribute Windows computers to their employees with a separate **admin** account with a separate password (often unknown to the user).

In order to install proofing tools on such machines, do the following:

1. Track down the person with the administrator password
2. Log out of your account and have the administrator log in to the administrators account (often called `.\admin`)
3. On that account, install the **Divvun Manager**, as explained on the [proofing page on divvun.no](https://divvun.no/en/korrektur/korrektur.html). When running the installer, remember to *run it as admin*.
4. Thereafter, log out of the admin account and back again on your ordinary account. Now, the proofing tools should be in place. Check it by opening e.g. Microsoft word and look for the green AB symbol next to the name of your language.


Other tools on the same page that must be installed will have to be installed in the same way. Web-based tools may be used without admin password.
