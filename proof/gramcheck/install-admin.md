    - The *Is this a test deployment* option is only used for filtering purposes in the Office Admin app, it has no effect beyond this.
    - It is often useful to enable it for only a small group of testers first, and then open up for a larger group or the whole organisation after testing
    - the groups have to be one of the following types:
        - Mail-Enabled Security
        - Distribution List
        - Microsoft 365
1. Click **Next > Next > Finnish deployment**
1. The app/Office Add-in will show up in the list of Administered Add-ons after a while.
