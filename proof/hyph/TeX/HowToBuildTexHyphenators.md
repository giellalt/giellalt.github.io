TeX /LibreOffice Hyphenators
============================

The TeX / LibreOffice hyphenation system uses trigram patterns to identify the
hyphenation points. The patterns are extracted automatically from a given list
of hyphenated words. In the GiellaLT infrastructure, this list is generated from
an FST with all hyphenation points in place. More information about this FST can
be found on the [FST hyphenation page]().

The build requires that you have `patgen` installed on your system.

Using MacPorts:

```sh
sudo port install texlive-bin-extra
```

Using Brew:

```sh
brew install texlive
```

or by installing [MacTex](https://www.tug.org/mactex/).

If `patgen` is not found by `./configure`, search for it as follows:

```sh
find /usr/local -name 'patgen'  
/usr/local/Cellar/texlive/20220321_4/bin/patgen
/usr/local/texlive/2022/bin/universal-darwin/patgen
```

then specify the preferred path to `./configure` as follows:

```sh
./configure --enable-pattern-hyphenators --with-patgen=/usr/local/texlive/2022/bin/universal-darwin/
```

Continue as below.

# Configuration and Build 

```sh
./configure --enable-pattern-hyphenators
make
```

This will create the following files:

```
XX_hyph.tex # For use with TeX processors
hyph_XX.dic # For use with LibreOffice and compatible systems
XX.pat      # Existing hyphenation patterns, if any
```

`XX` is a language code, and will vary from language
to language. It will be ISO 639-1 if available, ISO 639-3 if not.

# The `*.pat` file

This file is empty the first time you make the hyphenation files. On subsequent
runs, an existing `*.tex` is used as input. Thus, by running `make` several
times, the hyphenation files can be improved, as the patterns are adjusted to
accomodate new data generated by each run.

For this reason, the `*.dic` and `*.tex` files
**should be stored under version controll**.

# The `*.tra` file

Contains mappings from upper to lower case. The default file should be ok, but
have a look to ensure proper mapping. The file can be empty if no mapping beyond
the default ASCII is needed. Some further documentation can be found at the
following places:

# Makefile variables

The file `tools/hyphenation/Makefile.modification-pattern.am` contains some
variables that can be used to fine-tune the building process. They are (with
default values provided):

```make
PATTERN_WORD_LIST=15000
HYPH_START_FINISH="1 2"
PATR_START_FINISH="2 4"
GOOD_BAD_THRESHLD="1 1 1"
```
Explanations:

- `PATTERN_WORD_LIST` = size of generated word list for extracting patterns.
  The larger the better patterns are generated, but the longer the build time
  takes.
- `HYPH_START_FINISH`, `PATR_START_FINISH`, `GOOD_BAD_THRESHLD` = various settings
  for the `patgen` tool, see links to `patgen` documentation above.
