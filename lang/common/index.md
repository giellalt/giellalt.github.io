# Language models (transducers)

Working with LEXC, TWOLC and Constraint Grammar

## Transducers

- [Transducer infrastructure](../../infra/Infrastructure.md)
- [Tutorials for lexc, twolc and constraint grammar](Tutorials.html)
- [Test scripts and routines for work on the language models](developingwork.html)
- [Handling morphological variation in lexc](Variation_in_lexc.html)
- [Principles for common (language-independent) lexicon entries](PrinciplesForCommonTagsAndLexiconEntries.html)

### Specialised transducers

There is machinery in place to handle systematic variation in things like **orthography**, **writing systems**, **dialectal** variation and **geographical** variation. The setup for each is documented here:

- [Alternative orthographies](ALtOrth.md)
- Alternative Writing system (TBW)
- Dialectal variation (TBW)
- Geographic variation (TBW)

## Documentation of tags

These links document the different types of tags used in the grammar models.

- [How the different tags are interacting with the FSTs](DifferentFSTs.html)

- [Compoundtags](CompoundTags.html)
- [Morphological tags](MorphologicalTags.html)
- [Derivational tags](DerivationOverview.html)
- [Syntax](docu-sme-syntaxtags.html)
- [Dependency](docu-deptags.html)
- [Semantic tags](SemanticTags.html)

## Language-specific documentation

- [Work on each languages is documented on their respective pages](https://giellalt.github.io/LanguageModels.html)

## Obsolete documentation

Here we keep some documentation that _now is obsolete_, but that we
don't want to throw away. Sometimes looking at how things were before
help us understand the present situation, or it may support our memory.
