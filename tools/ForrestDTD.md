The Forrest dtd is documented on their site:

- [Basic documentation and howto](http://forrest.apache.org/dtdx/dtd-docs.html). Note that we use 2.0.
- [A visual introduction](http://forrest.apache.org/dtdx/document-v20.html)

Note that you must write _forrest validate_ before checking in. Running
the site locally (_f8_) is not enough, since your own computer is more
tolerant than the Forrest dtd.
