Preparing text for TTS
======================

Collect enough text to be read in as training material. The model may
be built based on 3-12 hours, a good target is 10 hours speech. This
should equal appr. 45000-50000 words. Collecting and especially
prepararing the text may take several months.

## Keep in mind:

1. The text should cover digraph sequences, consonant gradation strings, etc.
1. The text should be balanced topic-wise
1. It should contain numbers of different types (ordinals, cardinals,
   years, dates, clock expressions)
1. It should also contain loan words


## Links to text collections

So far, there has been built TTS systems for North, Lule and South
Sámi. Currently (2025), projects for Inari Sámi, Kven and Meänkieli
are under planning or in the making. Text collections are in closed
corpora, pendants to the open github repositories for the languages
for which TTS programs are being made. 

Here are the open git repositories:

* [Inari Sámi](https://github.com/giellalt/speech-smn/)
* [Kven](https://github.com/giellalt/speech-fkv/)
* [Livvi](https://github.com/giellalt/speech-olo/)
* [Lule Sámi](https://github.com/giellalt/speech-smj/)
* [North Sámi](https://github.com/giellalt/speech-sme/)
* [Soutn Sámi](https://github.com/giellalt/speech-sma/)
