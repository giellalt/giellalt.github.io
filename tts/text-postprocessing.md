Text postprocessing
===================


In this phase someone must correct the text and make sure that what is said is what is written (and eventually adjust the written text to follow the set) (speaker) (**xx months**)


- The recorded texts must be edited to match the recorded audio as accurately as possible. Also light mistakes, corrections, repetitions are kept and written out in the text transcript, exactly as said.
	- before editing, make a copy of the texts actually used in the studio recordings, and make changes to the copy. This way you keep a "pristine" version of the recording manuscript for future use and reference.
- It is very important to write out the numbers, abbreviations, acronyms and any pronunciation of special characters (like `@, /, -` etc.). People tend to read these unsystematically and the actual pronunciation of these may vary.
- Often, another round of audio cleaning will be also done at this point to remove all remaining coughs, mistakes that weren't noticed before.
