Text postprocessing
===================


In this phase someone must correct the text and make sure that what is said is what is written (and eventually adjust the written text to follow the set) (speaker) (**xx months**)


- The read texts must be edited to match the audio as accurately as possible. Also light mistakes, corrections, repetitions are kept and written out in the text transcript.
- It is very important to write out the numbers, abbreviations, acronyms and any pronunciation of special characters (like `@, /, -` etc.). People tend to read these unsystematically and the actual pronunciation of these may vary.
- Often, another round of audio cleaning will be also done at this point to remove all remaining coughs, mistakes that weren't noticed before.
