# Neutralizations in Guovdageaidnu dialect


```
gŋ, kŋ and ŋ –> dnj, tnj, nj
ddj, dj ->  žž, čč          (in some speakers)
tk, tkk ->  sk, skk
tm, tmm - > sm, smm
dn ->   tn                  (in some speakers)
ŧ:ŧ, ŧŧ, ŧ -> s:s, ss, s


hr:r, hr, hr -> r:r, rr, r  (in some speakers)
hl:l, hl, hl -> l:l, ll, l  (in some speakers)
hm ->           m           (in some speakers)
ih:l, ihll - >  il, ill     (in some speakers)
ih:m, ihmm ->   im, imm     (in some speakers)
ih:n; ihnn ->   in, inn     (in some speakers)
vh:l, vhll ->   vl, vll     (in some speakers)
```


In reading, the following contrasts should be maintained:


```
voiceless sonorants: i.e. skuhrrat vs. skurrat, liehmu vs. liema
palatalized stops:  moddját vs. gožžat, bidjat vs. gičču
t-clusters:         gotka vs. goaski, fátmi vs. leasmi
voiced nasal clusters:  eadni vs. eatni
ŧ:                      muoŧŧá vs. guossa
```


Notice also the difference between *muoŧŧái* (to maternal aunt) and ''muoŧ'ŧái*(having many maternal aunts). They are spelt the same way, but pronounced differently. Anticipating some disambiguation in the future, we should maintain the difference in reading.*Muoŧ'ŧái*is the only word with QIII quantity of*ŧ''.


(This leaves one neutralization, velar vs. coronal nasal clusters. I don't think it is realistic to expect speakers to be able to pronounce the velar clusters while at the same time maintaining good reading fluency.)


# Choice of words/suffixes


Some words have been chosen because they contain infrequent consonant centres. One example is *gieđbmi - gieđmmi*. The variant used in Guovdageaidnu is *gievdni - gievnni*. To ensure enough occurences of *đbm-đmm*, *gieđbmi* is used in the text, and must not be replaced by *gievdni*. 
Another one is *guđju*. It shoud not be read as *gulju*. 


Some words are represented with all their different consonant centres: 
*bispa* and *bisma* are both used in the texts, and should be read as written, to ensure enough occurrences of *sp* and *sm*.
The word for cloth can be pronounced in a number of ways, all of which are represented in the text, *limsku*, *livsku* and *linsku*. These should be read as they are written. All the consonant centres are infrequent and occur in few words.


The eastern suffix *-smit* is used three times, instead of western *-smuvvat*. This is to ensure enough occurrences of *–sm–* in the consonant margin. The same goes for *-rmit* instead of *-rmuvvat*.


The word *vuobirs* is used instead of *vuobis*, which is the more common variant. However, voice talents are instructed to read as the word is spelled.


The suffix *-lmas* has a different variant *-lvas*, which is used in the word *buozalvas*.


# Onsets


Certain onsets are typical of the Eastern dialects, such as *gl–*. The word *glássa* is *láse* in Guovdageaidnu. However, in order to ensure enough occurrences of *gl* in onset position, *glása* occurs in the text and should be reas as it is written. Other words are *flágga* and *flásku*.
The onset  *sr–*, is rare in the Guovdageaidni dialect. In the text, some words will occur with these onsets, such as *sroba*, and *srubistit* (*šlubistit* in Guovdag.), and the words should be pronounced as written.


The texts have been adapted to Guovdageaidnu reading, so the few "alien" things remaining, should be read as they are written.
