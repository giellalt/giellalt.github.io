# Developing TTS

This pages gives an overview of production of text-to-speech (TTS) programs for minority languages. Programs built so far can be found at the [Borealium resource page](https://borealium.org/category/text-to-speech/).


# Phases in the production process

1. [Collecting and preparing text to be used](text-preparation.html) (**several months**)
2. [Recording the texts](recording.md) (**one week** of studio time)
3. [Text postprocessing](text-postprocessing.md) (**months**)
4. [Splitting the recordings and text transcripts to sentence-long
   individual files, eventually splitting exceptionally long strings](sentence-alignment.md)
5. [Procedures for normalisation of input text](text-normalisation.md)
6. [Building a voice](building-voice.md)
7. [Combining parts and distribution](combining.md)
