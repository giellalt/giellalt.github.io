    Plan for aligner and analysis work

    Goal: Send analysed texts to Oslo on order 



    1. find parallel texts
    2. align
        several alignments of the same text
    3. analyse the sme part
    4. send to Oslo


    Solution:

    1. A document in CVS where we check in what is done
    2. Have a directory on victorio (G5?) where we keep track of what is done
    Store the aligned files, so that we can see how old they are
    Processing phases:
    corpus conversion  file.sme.xml, file.nob.xml
    numbered sentence phase file.sme.xml.sent, file.nob.xml.sent
    aligned  sentence phase (alignment.jar => xml_cor.sent files
    analysed phase (corpus-analyze.pl =>

    To be sent:
    file.nob.xml.sent (analysed in oslo, for the time being, at least)
    file.sme.xml.sent.analyzed
    file.sme.xml_file.nob.xml.xml  

    cor = result of the alignment

    Principled names:
    file.sme_new.txt               numbered <s id="n"> nodes only. This is
                                   the file which tca2 actually reads.
    file.sme.xml_file.nob.xml.xml  <s> number correspondences only
    file.sme.xml_cor.sent          original xml file with sme and nob <s> numbers

    Example:
    dc_1_01.doc.xml_sp_1_01.doc.xml.xml
    dc_1_01.doc.xml_cor.sent
    dc_1_01.doc.xml_new.txt  

    parallel/
     namm-namn/
      namn.sent
      namm.sent
      namm.sent.analyzed
      namm.xml_namn.xml.xml
     ... 
     
    1. Trond: Find texts, mark the xsl files (cf. dc_ files for model), tell Saara
    2. Saara: make .sent and .sent.analyzed
       Børre: make namm_namn.xml 
    3. Trond: Send files to Lars
