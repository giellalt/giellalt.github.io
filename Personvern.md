# Privacy

We do not collect any personally identifiable data. For repository access, GitHub does need some data like username etc.

Below are some tips on how to maximise your privacy in a GitHub context.

## Tips for GitHub Privacy

All accounts are public, but there is no need to fill it with info about yourself, including identifying info. Here are some tips:

- make a GitHub user name that can't be associated with you
    - you can even [change your existing username](https://github.com/settings/admin) - "Change username" (but check the list of negative consequences)
- on your [profile page](https://github.com/settings/profile):
    - don't use a profile picture resembling you
    - do not specify your location
    - no name
    - no URL
    - do not specify your employer
    - do not set a public email adress - "Public email" (let the field be empty)
- [keep your email adress private](https://github.com/settings/emails) - "Keep my email addresses private"
- [don't display GitHub organisation membership](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/publicizing-or-hiding-organization-membership), such as [giellalt](https://github.com/giellalt) eller [divvun](https://github.com/divvun)
  (GitHub organisations are like a common home for repositories belonging together)
  (e.g. [this organisation](https://github.com/orgs/udapi/people) has no public members)
