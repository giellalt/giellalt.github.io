OmegaT
======

OmegaT is an open source program for using translation memories when translating text. The best translation memory is the one built from one's own translations, but we also offer [translation memories for Nordic minority language pairs](TranslationMemories.html). There are [many CAT programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_computer-assisted_translation_tools), what is special with OmegaT (apart from being open source and free) is that you may integrate it with machine translation from Apertium, including machine translation between Saami languages.
